# yarg-lang

Yarg-Lang is a project to experiment with a dynamic language targetting microcontrollers.

## Aims

  - A dynamic environment for on-device prototyping
  - Tooling to deploy working prototypes
  - Sufficient static typing to reasonably add device specific code without writing C
  - Interop with C libraries available on device

Not (yet) intended for use. Additional documentation on the [wiki][wiki]
