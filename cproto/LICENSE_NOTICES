Commentary

It is my intention to licence this repository under the same MIT licence used
at: https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters

The intial commits were created by me typing in the code examples from the book, 
which are licenced in the repo above. That licence requires reposting the copyright
notice from Robert Nystrom below.

I believe a derivative of this repo would need the notice below included.
